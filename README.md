### Usage

To get started, clone the repo and run bundle to install the required gems:

```
git clone git@github.com:Benjamin-Hughes/bank_tech_test.git
bundle install

Next run rspec to check that everything is working:

```
bundle exec rspec

Now we can jump into IRB and create an account object with and owner and initial balance:

```ruby
my_account = Account.new('Ben', 5000)
```

.add_funds takes a numerical amount to increase the balance by:

```ruby
my_account.add_funds(1000)
```

.withdraw_funds takes a numerical amount to withdraw from the balance:

```ruby
my_account.withdraw_funds(1000)
```

.print_balance will print a transaction history:

```ruby
my_account.print_balance
```
